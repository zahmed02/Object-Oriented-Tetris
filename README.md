# Object-Oriented-Tetris
A Tetris game implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming principles, showcasing modular design, efficient game mechanics, and interactive gameplay.

## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tetris game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. The game is built using the Raylib library for graphics and user input handling.

## Features
- Dynamic grid for Tetris gameplay
- Multiple block types (Tetrominoes) with unique shapes
- Scoring system based on cleared lines
- Level progression with increasing difficulty
- High score tracking
- User input handling for block movement and rotation

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- To run the Tetris game, you need to have Raylib installed on your system
- CMake (optional, for building the project)
